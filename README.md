- 👋 Hi, I’m **@CappnC**
- 👀 I’m interested in software development in general! But I'm focused specifically, at this point, on creating FiveM Scripts!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to further my ability to create FiveM Scripts. But I also know a bit of C++, Python, LUA, and Go. (Though I'm very new at Go)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FiveM Scripts. Shocker. I've wanted to create an immersive Roleplay server ever since I learned that GTA RP was back in GTA V (I played a lot of it in the GTA:SA:MP days. Yeah. I'm *THAT* old.)
  I've been working on a few scripts for the fairly newish QBCore Framework. So if you're interested in helping out, reach out to me!
- 📫 You can reach me here (**@CappnC**), Discord: **TheCappn#6994**, and email. Though I don't make that public, so if you have it, you can reach me there!
